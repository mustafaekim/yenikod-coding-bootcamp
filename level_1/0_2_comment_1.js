// That's how we can add 'single line' comment into our code
// These lines will be ignored by the JavaScript interpreter (not compiler)
// JavaScript understand that this is a comment because of the "comment tag": //
// Whatever comes after the "comment tag" (//) is considered to be a comment
// While commenting, we are free to write anything that will help us better understand the code

// In a real source code:
    // Exessive commenting is a bad pattern which should be avoided
        // Why-Because: If code changes but comments remain same, the comments may not be valid anymore, hence it may cause harm in our understanding of the code
        // Keeping comments and codes aligned may be a difficult task in the long run. That's why we avoid exessive commenting
    // The best is that our code expresses itself
        // When the code does not expresses itself clearly, we should first refactor (modify) the code so that it does.
        // If still we feel like a comment is necessary, we do add comments
    // Comments are for explaining WHYs rather than WHATs

// Comments can be added at the end of a line, again by first putting the comment tag.

// Below is another way to add comment into our code. 

// We can add multiple-line comments by wrapping our comment between the tags /* and */
// Do not forget to close the commenting are so that your codes are not ignored.
// Below is an example for multiple line comment:

/*
    Warning: You will observe exessive commenting in this series,
    because our aim is not to explain WHYs or WHATs but HOWs
*/
