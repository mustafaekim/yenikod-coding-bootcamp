/* 
    OO (Object Oriented) or Class Oriented programming want you to associate data and behaviour that operates on the data, under the Object/Class umbrella
    The goal is to achieve encapsulation.
    An object is mean to be a package of both data and behaviour

    JavaScript classes and Object orientation is very different from other OO programming language
    Everytime you learn a new language, you have to first understand it's paradigm and approaches to solving real-world problems

    In JavaScript, classes are an optional pattern.

    In classical OO programming languages, class is a blueprint. 
    Each time you instantiate an object instance, you actually copy/create the data and behaviour described on the blueprint
    and make the blueprint something real.
    You can think of a blueprint as a plan or a set of instruction for constructing an object.
    So object construction is actually a copy-like operation. Once the construction is over, there is no link between the class and the object.

    In JavaScript, there is no such thing as blueprint or class but only concrete instances of objects.
    Those objects may be linked to each other to delegate behaviours.
    In JavaScript, objects can prototype linked to a single object. (single parent)
    In JavaScript, when you think you are instantating an object, you actually create a new object that is linked to another object.
