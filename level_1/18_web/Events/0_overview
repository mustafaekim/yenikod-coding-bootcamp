* Every DOM element has its own addEventListener method which allows you to listen specifically on that element.
    - addEventListener allows you to add any number of handlers
* Giving a node an onclick attribute has a similar effect but a node has one onclick attribute
    - so you can register only one handler per node that way
* removeEventListener
* event handler function is passed an argument: the event object, which gives additional information about the event.


* Event propagation: Event handlers registered on nodes with children will also receive some events that happen on children
    - use stopPropagation() on event object inside the event handler function

* Many events have a default action associated with them. 
    - i.e. If you click a link, you wil be taken on the link's target
    - For most types of events, the JavaScript event handlers are called before the default behaviour action performed.
    - If the handler does not want the normal behaviour to happen, it can call the preventDefault() method on the event object
