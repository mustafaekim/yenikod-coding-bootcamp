/*
    You should have a clear understanding and you should be able to explain very clearly without giving examples!
        Is JavaScript a compiled or an interpreted language?
        Explain briefly what's value, type, operator, expression and statement.
        What's strict mode vs non-strict mode?
        What's lexical scope? When does it get structured?
        Explain the difference between var, const and let.
        What's hoisting? In which phase does it happen?
        What's a closure?    
        Why would I ever use IIFE?
        What's a higher order function?
        What does pass-by-value and pass-by-reference mean? How do they work? When do they happen?
        What does immutable mean? Explain immutability.
        How does new operator work?
        How does this operator work?
        How does prototype mechanism work?
        How does exception work?

    You should be able to solve problems involving
        loops + recursion + hof + closure + prototype + this
