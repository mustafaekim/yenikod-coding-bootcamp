// false represents the boolean value false

// number, string, boolean, null and undefined are built-in primitive value types
// numbers are represented by number literals (i.e.: 100, 123, 1999, 1.5, 154.2545)
// strings are represented by string literals (i.e.: "a", "Mustafa", "Mustafa Ekim", "Hi Mustafa!")

/*
    So we have learned 5 value types:
        * number
        * string
        * boolean
        * null
        * undefined
    
    Please recognise that values and value types are different.
    1 is a number literal. It represents a value of type number.
    14, 0.1 and 129 are also valid number literals and they all represent a different value but the type of those values is number
