// We've already learned that we seperate statements by putting semicolons between the statements
// We do not have to start a statement in a new line
// Actually we can put as many statements as we want in a single line, as long as we seperate statements with semicolon

var x; x=5;

/*
    So the code above is same as:
    var x;
    x=5;
*/

// I personally always start a new statement in a new line
    // WHY: because it is more readable. It costs me less effort to read it
