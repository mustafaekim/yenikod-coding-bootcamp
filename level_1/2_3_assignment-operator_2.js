// variable statement can (optionally) be extended so that the statement also initialize the variable to a value

var myName = "Mustafa";

/*
    For now, you can think of the code above as if it was written as below:
    var myName;
    myName = "Mustafa";
*/


/*
    Here is how I read this statement:
        * I declare a variable with the name myName, and assign a string value ("Mustafa") into the variable
    
    Or, step by step:
        1) myName is variable
        2) myName holds a string value ("Mustafa")
            or: A string value ("Mustafa") is assigned into the variable "myName"
