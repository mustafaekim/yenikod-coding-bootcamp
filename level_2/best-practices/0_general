- READABILITY
    * Use conventions so that your code becomes more predictable for readers.

- GENERAL
    * Use semicolons for ending statements
    * Don't extend or modify the built-ins
    
    
- FUNCTIONS
    * Never modify the arguments object
    * Make functions do a single, clear thing.
    * Use closure to store private data
    
- PROTOTYPES
    * Don't modify __proto__, use Object.create()
    * Store methods on prototypes, store mutable-per-instance state on instance objects

- SCOPE
    * Avoid declaring global variables.
    * Declare variables as locally as possible.
    * Use IIFE to create local scope.

- OBJECT
    * Use object literal instead of 'new Object()'
    * use array literal instead of 'new Array()'
