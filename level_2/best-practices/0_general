* Use semicolons for ending statements
* Never modify the arguments object
* Don't modify __proto__, use Object.create()
* Store methods on prototypes, store mutable-per-instance state on instance objects
* Use closure to store private data
* Use conventions so that your code becomes more predictable for readers.
* Make functions do a single, clear thing.

- SCOPE
    * Avoid declaring global variables.
    * Declare variables as locally as possible.
    * Use IIFE to create local scope.
