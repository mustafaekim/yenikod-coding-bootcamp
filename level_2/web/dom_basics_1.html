<!--
    DOM (document object model) is a LIVE model that represents the document's structure
    In JavaScript sandbox environment, that model is given as a global variable: document
        document.documentElement: is a property whose value is an object that represents the HTML tag
        document.head is a property whose value is an object that represent the HEAD tag
        document.body is a property whose value is an object that represent the BODY tag

    DOM has a tree like structure that represents the HTML file structure
        Each node may refer to other nodes, children, which may have their own children. (single root, nested/recursive, without cycles)
        document.documentElement is the ROOT element.
        There are several types of nodes. Each node has a nodeType property whose value represent the type of the node
    
    Traverse the tree through nodes:
        parentNode, childNodes, firstChild, lastChild, previousSibling, nextSibling

    Tranverse the tree through (not 100% compatible)
        children, childElementCount, firstElementChild, lastElementChild, nextElementSibling, previousElementSibling

    Select an element:
        getElementsByTagName("p")[0]
        getElementById("main")
        getElementByClassName("hot")

    Use Query Selector
        document.querySelector("#main")
        document.querySelector("#main > p[target]")
        querySelectorAll()


    Attributes (are not part of DOM tree, they are properties of element node objects)
        - you can access using the dot notation on the element object
        - some attribute names are restricted to be accessed through the dot notation (which are reserved keyworkd for JS: class, for)
            - getAttribute(name), setAttribute(name, value), hasAttribute(name), removeAttribute(name)
            - node.attributes (readonly)

        class attibutes: can take multiple class names, hence it can be managed through a API
            node.classList.add(class), node.classList.remove(class), node.classList.toggle(class), node.classList.contains(class)
    
    Change the document:

        node.innerHTML (read/write)
        node.outerHTML
        node.insertAdjacentHTML (beforebegin, afterbegin, beforeend, afterend)

        removeChild
        appendChild
        insertBefore
        replaceChild
        createElement
        createTextNode


    Each node object 
-->
<html>

<head>


</head>

<body>
    <p class="cold"  >Hi guys, that's my first paragraph</p>
    <div>That's my first div</div>
    <div>
        I have some texts without element, which is a simple text node.
        <p>Then, I have a paragraph inside my first div</p>

    </div>




    <script>
        var myNewTextNode = document.createElement("p");
        myNewTextNode.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Hello JS!"));
        document.body.lastElementChild.before(myNewTextNode);
    </script>
</body>

</html>
